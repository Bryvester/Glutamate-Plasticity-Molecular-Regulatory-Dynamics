# Glutamate-Plasticity-Molecular-Regulatory-Dynamics
# Python program “The Glutamate Plasticity Dynamics” works on the dynamics and parameters calculation in 《Connecting the Dots: A Computational Framework linking Molecular Regulation, Synaptic Plasticity, and Brain Disorders》
# 1, The Boolean dynamics is simulated on the simplified networks in the paper.

# 2, In the main Python file, the simplified dynamics, dynamics of knock-out nodes and betweenness calculation are simulated.

# 3, The simplified network and all networks after nodes knock-out in the paper are saved as “.csv” files，the file “nodes_interaction_G_named.xlsx” contains the simplified network with nodes name, the nodes sequence in the knock-out networks are the same as original one.
